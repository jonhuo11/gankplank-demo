## gangplank-demo
Created together with Taehoon Kim, Adeeb Mahmud, and Atif Mahmud for the GI Jams 2020 summer jam.

Tech demo for a graphical rendering and asset production pipeline created in 42 hours for the 
UW Games Institute summer jam of 2020. User friendly pipeline that enables game developers to turn animated 3D models into detailed 2D sprite sheets that include beautiful, dynamic 2D normal maps. Created a visually striking "ToonLit" shader in C++ for the Unity3D engine that converts smooth, 
3D shadows into 2D pixel-art style shading.

Currently the project is a tech demo and is not a representation of a fully implemented product. There is a full explanation and demo in the presskit, and a fully playable game created with sprite assets from the rendering pipeline is available to download in the builds folder (reduced to meet github filesize requirements).
